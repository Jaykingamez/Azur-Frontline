    As humanity's numbers plummeted, corporations found themselves in a hole as the number of
    available workers was drastically lowered. To save themselves from having to overpay workers due
    to this labour shortage, big companies began to heavily invest and purchase dolls to work in their
    offices. This gambit was highly successfully in keeping corporations afloat as the dolls could fill
    any needed role within the office space.
    Unfortunately, this dependence on dolls was a temporary one as humanity began to stabilize itself.
    Soon, human labour shortages began receding and many office working dolls lost their jobs. Griffon
    is the best hope any of them have at achieving a new life, moving away from the calm and safe
    space of skyscrapers to the chaotic and tumultuous battlefield.

    In times of emergency, there are nowhere near enough human professionals to treat all the possibly
    injured and dying patients on the scene. Dolls can thankfully make-up this deficit, programmed with
    all the knowledge to prolong a patient’s life to at least get to to a hospital. The more advanced
    models can even perform the needed operation on the spot provided they could sterilize the
    surroundings and have the necessary tools at hand.
    These types of dolls are always being recruited into Griffon if possible, as their expert medical
    knowledge can sometimes be transitioned into working on T-dolls on the field. It may take some

    time to get used to working with wires and oil instead of flesh and blood, but the ability to keep a T-
    doll operational for long-term operations is incredibly valuable nonetheless. Combat duty is often

    considered secondary to this primary task.

    With the spread of ELID, many environments have long since been rendered toxic and
    uninhabitable for humanity. This has resulted in the loss of several resource sites that society
    depends on for rare materials and the like. To that end, some dolls have been made to explicitly
    work in these contaminated environments, going where humanity cannot.
    However, working in ELID environments is but one field that these dolls are active in. They are
    also utilized in high-risk settings such as deep mines or extreme temperatures, replacing fragile
    humans who are too valuable to commit to these tasks. Studier and improved alloys are used in the
    manufacture of the dolls to ensure that they can work in any dangerous situation, needing very little
    in additional protection.

    “As if I'd let any enemy escape me!”
    - Tactical Doll Handgun Python

    The majority of Griffon's T-dolls are formerly civilian dolls that have been retrofitted with a combat
    core and additional other systems, which has been effective against the near-infinite numbers of
    Sangvis Ferri. They are also far better individually than the grunts of the enemy, allowing for
    Griffon squads to cut through swathes of enemy dolls with little trouble. However, when it comes to
    a the next level above the grunts, it is practically impossible for inexperienced converted civilian
    doll to match any of the Sangvis Ferri ringleaders, which is a substantial problem if any of them
    should decide to deploy on the battlefield.
    To that end, the IOP Manufacturing Company offer Griffon a rather exclusive deal of custom-made
    T-dolls built exclusively for combat. These dolls would never know life outside Griffon, making it
    hard for them to form any social bonds in theory but they would be the masters of war in all its
    forms. To be given an entire squad of such elite dolls is considered to be a great honour within
    Griffon, but to date, very few have been given command of one.
